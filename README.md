# Screen Automation Script

## Overview

This Python script utilizes computer vision techniques to automate interactions with a live screen. It identifies predefined regions using template matching, reads configuration data from "order.txt," and performs mouse movements and clicks based on the specified conditions. The script is designed for scenarios where manual interactions with specific screen elements are repetitive and can be automated.

## Key Features

- **Template Matching:** Utilizes OpenCV for template matching to identify specific regions on the screen.
- **Configuration File:** Reads input parameters from the "order.txt" configuration file for dynamic control.
- **Mouse Automation:** Performs mouse movements and clicks based on the identified regions and configuration.
